At this very first work we have selected vapor quality for searching of appropriate probability equation. The reason is following, vapor quality easy to observe with optical methods and bubbles quite descriptive to understand variational approach.  In fact, we are searching for complex function describing probability {0;1} of volume fraction for each point of water tank. In particular, there is a conditional probability for each pixel of image in case of known state of all pixels at previous moments of time

  where x pixel value for every image part, t -time, z- number of random variables with the normal distribution. The bright value of each pixel x is derived of particular liquid volume fraction attributed as 0 in case of 100% vapour or 1 in case of 100% liquid.
